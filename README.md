# Intro to Java (Q&A/Overview Guide)
**Definition/Overview:** [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is a high-level, secure, and multi-threaded *object-oriented* programming (OOP) language. It has many use cases and remains popular across many platforms/devices due to its strong compatibility/portability, as well as its memory efficiency/performance advantages in comparison to many other compiled languages. Its design is credited to James Gosling of Sun Microsystems, which has since been purchased by the [Oracle Corporation](https://www.oracle.com/).
  
Java is also renowned for its *APIs* (Application Programming Interfaces), which have both minor and major differences across Java versions. Each API contains pre-built packages and classes that can be imported into programs to provide commonly used features/functionalities.
